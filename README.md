## OpenACC

[OpenACC](https://www.openacc.org/) is a user-driven directive-based performance-portable parallel programming model designed for scientists and engineers interested in porting their codes to a wide-variety of heterogeneous HPC hardware platforms and architectures with significantly less programming effort than required with a low-level model.

## Threading Building Blocks (TBB)

Intel [Threading Building Blocks (TBB)](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) lets you easily write parallel C++ programs that take full advantage of **multicore performance**, that are portable and composable, and that have future-proof scalability.
